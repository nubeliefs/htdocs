Non universal beliefs is an unbiased way of thinking and developing a belief which holds true for every situation. We believe in deep analysis on the subject to get into its depth. Our purpose is to share the knowledge and to bring change in the ways we think. We believe that our mind is so much like a water which can transform and easily adapts to its surrounding, you might think that you're stubborn and you don't listen to anyone but involuntarily you are listening to whatever your mind is saying you to do it can be a good thing or a bad thing, but you perform both so proudly without a second thought because you think that what you just did is all under your control but that is actually in control of your mind. So, basically your mind is the one which controls you its not 'you' who control yourself. Our main motive is to train your mind to think unbiasedly on anything which matters to our lives directly or indirectly.
